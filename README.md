# My Danmakufu Projects
 A backup folder for all my projects for Danmakufu.
 Danmakufu, for anyone who might eventually be looking around here, is an engine and C-like-ish programming language, designed specifically to create Touhou-like games. 
 Touhou, if you do not know, is a great and charming series of indie "bullet hell" shooters, that I hold dear.
 So I did a bunch of stuff like it. And hopefully I will keep doing so in the future.
